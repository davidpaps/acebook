# AceBook

This was the second of the group projects at Makers. This time we had 2 weeks, and the brief was to complete a clone of Facebook. This was our first time using the Ruby on Rails framework, bootstrap design tools, as well as the Travis Continous Intergration tools and Rubocop linter. We also added a OAUTH Github Login, as well as a websocket request for the chat function. Overall lots of new concepts and tech were discovered, learned and put into prduction over the fortnight.

It was a very enjoyable time working with the team. We worked closely, used AGILE practises and had constant feedback over the 2 week project, using stand-ups every morning, retrospectives every evening. The original repo can be found [_here_](https://github.com/asiaellis5/acebook-U-JAKD) - huge shout out to the team members Asia, Jack, Katie and Umberto. I enjoyed the project and learnt so much in such a short space of time. I gained valuable continuous integration and Rails skills gained over the course of this project, as well as an insight into the bootstrap/css world.

We kept a running blog over the two week project that can be viewed [_here_](blog.md).

## Project

This project was aimed to simulate real life product delivery in the workplace. We had both a technical lead, and a product manager. We had strict requirements from the product manager that we had to adhere to, we then converted them into [_user stories_](userstories.md) and worked via 2 day sprints to deliver these features.

We also copied these user stories onto our group [_Trello Board_](https://trello.com/b/M4b8WWOm/u-jakd), making sure to update the status of each user story as and when they were actioned - then moving them into the relevant column.

You can find the endineering project outline [_here_](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/engineering_projects/rails).

This project is designed to act as a social media site where users can:

- Sign up/ Sign in (also via Github) and sign out,
- Post content to their own wall, other uses walls or a joint wall,
- Comments can be added to each post,
- 'Likes' can be added to each post and/or comments, limited to one per user (then an unlike function is shown),
- Each username is a link to that persons own wall,
- A user can change their username at any time via the edit account function,
- Any users signed in on the site can click on the 'chat' button and be entered into a live chatroom.
